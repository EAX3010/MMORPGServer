# MMORPG Server

A high-performance MMORPG server implementation built with .NET 9 for learning and skill development purposes.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is created for **educational purposes** to:
- Learn modern C# and .NET development
- Practice network programming concepts
- Understand MMORPG server architecture
- Sharpen programming skills

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **.NET 9** - Latest .NET framework
- **C# 13** - Modern C# features
- **Custom networking** - TCP socket-based communication
- **Diffie-Hellman** - Key exchange for secure communication
- **CAST5 encryption** - Custom cryptographic implementation

## ✨ Features

- **High-performance networking** with async/await patterns
- **Secure communication** using Diffie-Hellman key exchange
- **Rate limiting** and flood protection
- **Modular service architecture**
- **Memory-efficient packet handling**
- **Comprehensive logging**

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- .NET 9 SDK
- Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code

### Running the Server
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd MMORPGServer
dotnet run
```

The server will start on port `10033` by default.

## 📚 Learning Focus Areas

- **Network Programming**: TCP socket handling, packet serialization
- **Security**: Cryptographic implementations, secure key exchange
- **Performance**: Memory management, async programming
- **Architecture**: Service-oriented design, dependency injection
- **Game Development**: MMORPG server concepts and patterns

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is a **learning project** and not intended for production use. The code is designed for educational purposes to explore and understand MMORPG server development concepts.
